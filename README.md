# Flashcard_app
Greetings!
This is just a simple universal flashcard app made by me and based on my own language study strategy when I'm learning foreign languages.
The point of this app(or the most different part from most of language learning app that I have used)is, 
not only you can use it like most of apps to learn word recognition by both text way and audio way(by gtts),

moreover, you can learn oral expression by reverse way

I also upload an exe version of this app, you can download it to use directly.
Once you double click this exe file, another file called 'words.json' will generate at the same path to store all the word in the list.
If you want to move this app to other folder, don't forget move 'words.json' as well.

I have no idea if this kind of language learning strategy already exist, but I conclue it on my own, then I want to share this strategy and this app to anyone who want to learn foreign languages.
Feel free to use it. If there is any problem or any contact request, send mail to: tenri.coding@gmail.com
