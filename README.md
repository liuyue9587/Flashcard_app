# Flashcard_app
Greetings!
This is just a simple universal flashcard app made by my own and based on my own study strategy when I'm learning foreign languages.
The point of this app(or the most different part from most of language learning app that I have used)is, 
not only you can use it like most of apps to learn word recognition by both text way and audio way(by gtts),

moreover, you can learn oral expression by reverse way

I have no idea if this kind of language learning strategy already exist, but I conclue it on my own, then I want to share this strategy and this app to anyone who want to learn foreign languages.
Feel free to use it. If there is any problem or any contact request, send mail to: tenri.coding@gmail.com
